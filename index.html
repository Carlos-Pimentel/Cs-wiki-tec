      <section class="main-section" id="Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive"><header>Counter Strike Global Offensive</header><p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a 2012 multiplayer tactical first-person shooter developed by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. Developed for over two years, Global Offensive was released for OS X, PlayStation 3, Windows, and Xbox 360 in August 2012, and for Linux in 2014.

The game pits two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, against each other in different objective-based game modes. The most common game modes involve the Terrorists planting a bomb while Counter-Terrorists attempt to stop them, or Counter-Terrorists attempting to rescue hostages that the Terrorists have captured. There are nine official game modes, all of which have distinct characteristics specific to that mode. The game also has matchmaking support that allows players to play on dedicated Valve servers, in addition to community-hosted servers with custom maps and game modes. A battle-royale game-mode, "Danger Zone", was introduced in late 2018. </p><p>Global Offensive received positive reviews from critics on release, who praised the game for its gameplay and faithfulness to the Counter-Strike series, though it was criticized for some early features and the differences between the console and PC versions. Since its release, it has drawn in an estimated 11 million players per month and remains one of the most played games on Valve's Steam platform. In December 2018, Valve transitioned the game to a free-to-play model, focusing on revenue from cosmetic items.

The game has an active esports scene, continuing the history of international competitive play from previous games in the series. Teams compete in professional leagues and tournaments, with the game often cited as being among the best in esports.

Counter-Strike 2, a major update bringing the game to the Source 2 engine, was announced on March 22, 2023, and was released on September 27, 2023. Official matchmaking for Global Offensive was shut down that day, though players were still able to connect to community servers. A legacy version of Global Offensive was later released for outdated devices and platforms unable to run Counter-Strike 2, though matchmaking was still disabled. Additionally, the game remains playable on Xbox 360. </p></section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Game_Objective"><header>Game Objective</header><p>Global Offensive, like prior games in the Counter-Strike series, is an objective-based, multiplayer first-person shooter. Two opposing teams, the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, compete in game modes to repeatedly complete objectives, such as securing a location to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing or capturing hostages.[1][2] At the end of each short round, players are rewarded based on individual and team performance with in-game currency to spend on other weapons or utility in subsequent rounds.[3] Winning rounds generally rewards more money than losing does, and completing map-based objectives, including killing enemies, gives additional cash bonuses.</p><p>Global Offensive has nine official game modes: Competitive, Casual, Deathmatch, Arms Race, Demolition, Wingman, Flying Scoutsman, Retakes and Danger Zone.[5][6][7][8] Competitive mode, the primary gameplay experience,[9] pits two teams of five players against each other in a best-of-30 match.[10] When playing Competitive, players have a skill rank based on a Glicko rating system and are paired with and against other players around the same ranking.[1] The Casual and Deathmatch modes are less serious than Competitive mode and do not register friendly fire. Both are primarily used as a practice tool.[11][12] Arms Race and Demolition, both based on mods for previous iterations in the series, were added alongside eight new maps for the modes.[1] Arms Race is the Global Offensive variant of the "Gun Game" mode in other games in the series.[1] Demolition is another bomb defusal game mode, with gun upgrades only given to players who killed an enemy in the previous round.[1] Wingman is a two-on-two bomb defusal game mode taking place over sixteen rounds. Similar to Competitive, players are paired based on a dynamic skill ranking.</p></section>

   <code>Words from MGG Brasil</code>
  <p>CS:GO is known for having a competitive scene with an extensive number of large-scale competitions throughout the season, with emphasis on the Majors, Valve's FPS world championships. Despite the large number of teams that have won Tier1 world championships, there are few teams that actually make it onto the list of the best of all time, although the game's history is still being written and, it seems, is far from over. .</p>

    The Major is the most important competition in CS:GO. It is considered the World Cup on the calendar and takes place twice a year, that is, always in the first and second semesters.

Because it is so relevant, the Major is the only event “controlled” by Valve. The owner of Counter-Strike chooses a company to carry out the structural procedures, but it is the supreme entity of the tournament. It's as if FIFA were selecting the venues for the World Cup.

In 2022, for example, the Majors were organized by PGL, in Belgium, and ESL, in Brazil. They lifted the Faze Clan and Outsiders cups, respectively.
